## 🌟 ZeroML – The Hybrid ML Platform

ZeroML is a **visual-first, fully extensible ML platform** that lets you:

* Build end-to-end ML pipelines with **drag-and-drop ease**
* Train, fine-tune, and optimize models efficiently
* Clean and version data with **prompt-driven automation**
* Deploy **production-grade APIs** in seconds

All pipelines, models, and datasets are **fully versioned** and ready for collaboration.

## 🧠 Hybrid Strategy

| Model Size | Training             | Deployment   | Versioning       |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Small      | Local / Hugging Face | HF Endpoints | Hugging Face Hub |
| Large      | RunPod               | RunPod API   | Hugging Face Hub |

> Showcase fast, scale smart, and manage all your ML assets centrally.
